# OMV6-DOCKER 

> I found most of the guide are based on portainer and after some trial and error... It seems working, here is the guide for my own reference when I started to use jdownloader in docker.

1. Install plugins ![image](https://github.com/khewweifeng/OMV6-DOCKER/assets/54496743/5bcbc8cf-f578-4969-a4c6-5bbaf416990d)

3. Reboot OMV
4. After reboot - services - compose - settings - default storage can be changed based on user preferences ... youtube have many video guides for this, I referred to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-OWVwpoGow&t=0s (setup omv and share folders)
5. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ICHdvSGHVs (setup docker / portainer in omv)
6. OMV have "add from example" and you just need to edit your desired path ![image](https://github.com/khewweifeng/OMV6-DOCKER/assets/54496743/bf031af7-f32a-4261-9b43-588a46b1738b)
